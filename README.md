# Ethical_Email_Phishing_Simulation
Email phishing simulation is a cybersecurity training exercise where organizations send fake, but realistic, phishing emails to their own employees. The purpose is not to hack them, but to test and improve their ability to recognize and avoid phishing attacks in a safe environment.

**Gophish** is an open-source phishing framework designed for businesses and penetration testers to simulate real-world phishing attacks. It makes it easy to create, launch, and track phishing campaigns in a user-friendly and powerful way.

> üöÄ Gophish is fast, self-hosted, and highly customizable to fit your organization‚Äôs security awareness needs.
